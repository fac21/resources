# Resources
A collection of resources for any topic that you might need! Started by previous cohorts and continued by you! âœ¨

This repo is a place to store all the wonderful resources you stumble across. Look to [FAC20's resources](https://github.com/fac20/resources) if you need some inspiration!

## How to add a resource

In order to keep some semblance of order in this library, please add your resource to the correct category, and make sure it includes the following things.

- link to the specific page
- short description of why it's cool/life-saving
- the GitHub handle of the person who shared it (who do we send the flowers to?)

#### Example

| Link                       | Description                                                     | Added by     |
| -------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------ |
